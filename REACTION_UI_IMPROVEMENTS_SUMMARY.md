# Reaction UI Improvements Summary

## Issue Fixed
The "Pick a reaction" functionality in the Comments tab of tasks was not clearly visible. Reaction icons were too small and lacked proper visual clarity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Existing Reaction Display
**Before:** Small, hard-to-see reaction icons with minimal contrast
**After:** Larger, clearer reaction icons with better visual hierarchy

**Key Improvements:**
- Increased emoji size from `text-sm` to `text-base` 
- Enhanced padding: `px-2.5 py-1.5` for better touch targets
- Improved border styling: `border-2` with better colors
- Added shadows: `shadow-sm hover:shadow-md` for depth
- Better spacing with `gap-1.5` and `flex-wrap` for responsiveness

### 2. Optimized Emoji Picker Layout
**Before:** Large, overwhelming emoji picker that took up significant space
**After:** Compact, organized picker with clear hierarchy

**Key Improvements:**
- Reduced emoji button padding from `p-4` to `p-2.5`

- Enhanced shadows: `shadow-sm hover:shadow-md`
- Font weight improvements: `font-semibold` for labels
- Better hover states with color transitions
- Consistent styling across Reply and React buttons

### 4. Improved Visual Hierarchy
**Before:** Elements were crowded and hard to distinguish
**After:** Clear separation and hierarchy of UI elements

**Key Improvements:**
- Better spacing: `gap-3` instead of `space-x-4`
- Flex-wrap layout: `flex-wrap` for responsive behavior
- Enhanced contrast for user reactions vs available reactions
- Clear visual feedback for selected/active states

### 5. Better Accessibility & UX
**Before:** Limited accessibility and unclear interactions
