# Fixes Completed - January 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Generate Demo Data: HTTP 502 Error
**Problem**: Backend was crashing with HTTP 502 when trying to generate demo data.

**Root Cause**: Missing `libmagic` system library required by the `python-magic` package used in the S3 file service.

**Solution**:
- Installed `libmagic1` system package: `apt-get install -y libmagic1`
- Restarted backend service
- Backend now starts successfully and all endpoints are working

**Verification**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/system/generate-demo-data
# Returns: {"success": true, "message": "Comprehensive demo data generated successfully!", ...}
```

### 2. ✅ Auto Fill with Sign In: HTTP 502 Error  
**Problem**: Login functionality was failing with HTTP 502 error.

**Root Cause**: Same as issue #1 - backend service was not starting due to missing libmagic library.

**Solution**:
- Fixed by installing libmagic1 (same fix as issue #1)
- Login endpoint now works correctly

**Verification**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"demo@company.com","password":"demo123456"}'
# Returns: {"message":"Login successful","tokens":{...},"user":{...}}
```
