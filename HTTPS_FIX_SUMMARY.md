# HTTPS Mixed Content Security Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The application was experiencing Mixed Content Security Errors where:
- Frontend was served over HTTPS: `https://project-viewer-12.preview.emergentagent.com`
- API calls were being made to HTTP: `http://project-404.preview.emergentagent.com/api/`
- Browsers block HTTP requests from HTTPS pages for security reasons

## Root Cause
1. Hardcoded HTTP URLs in configuration files
2. Inconsistent environment detection for emergentagent.com domains
3. Multiple places with duplicate API URL logic instead of centralized configuration

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Environment Detection (`/app/frontend/src/utils/environment.ts`)
- Enhanced `getApiUrl()` function to force HTTPS for emergentagent.com domains
- Added server-side rendering support with HTTPS forcing
- Improved debugging and logging for environment detection

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration (`/app/frontend/vite.config.ts`)
- Fixed proxy configuration to use HTTPS for emergentagent.com domains
- Updated build-time environment variable injection to force HTTPS
- Enhanced production API URL detection

### 3. Removed Hardcoded URLs
**Files Fixed:**
- `/app/frontend/src/components/organization/InviteMembersModal.tsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/security/MFASetup.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced hardcoded `https://project-viewer-12.preview.emergentagent.com` fallbacks
- Consolidated all API URL logic to use centralized `config.apiUrl`
- Added proper imports for config utility

### 4. Enhanced Configuration Centralization (`/app/frontend/src/utils/config.ts`)
- All API endpoints now use dynamic `getApiUrl()` function
- Consistent HTTPS enforcement across all API calls
- Better debugging and environment logging

## Test Results
✅ Environment detection works correctly
✅ HTTP URLs are automatically converted to HTTPS for emergentagent.com
✅ All API endpoints use HTTPS consistently  
✅ No mixed content security errors
✅ Services restarted successfully

## Technical Details
- **Domain Detection**: Automatically detects `emergentagent.com` domains
- **URL Transformation**: `http://` → `https://` for emergentagent.com domains
- **Centralized Config**: Single source of truth for API URL generation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Still works for localhost development

## Security Improvement
This fix prevents Mixed Content Security Errors which can:
- Block API requests entirely
- Cause authentication failures
- Break application functionality
- Create poor user experience

## Files Modified
1. `/app/frontend/src/utils/environment.ts` - Enhanced HTTPS forcing
2. `/app/frontend/vite.config.ts` - Fixed build and proxy configuration  
3. `/app/frontend/src/components/organization/InviteMembersModal.tsx` - Removed hardcoded URLs
4. `/app/frontend/src/components/security/MFASetup.tsx` - Removed hardcoded URLs

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All changes have been applied and services restarted successfully.
