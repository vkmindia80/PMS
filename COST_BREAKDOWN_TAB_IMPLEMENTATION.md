## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailsPage.tsx`

### Changes Made
1. Updated `TabType` to include 'cost'
2. Added cost tab to tabs array
3. Created comprehensive `CostBreakdownTab` component
4. Added tab content rendering

### Component Structure
```typescript
const CostBreakdownTab: React.FC<any> = ({ 
  project, 
  tasks, 
  users, 
  budgetUtilization 
}) => {
  // State management for views and filters
  // Cost calculations
  // Multiple view renderings
}
```

### Data Flow
```
Project Data â†’ Budget Calculation â†’ Cost Breakdown â†’ Visual Display
     â†“              â†“                    â†“                â†“
- budget      - categories        - by category    - cards
- tasks       - task costs        - by task        - charts
- users       - team costs        - by team        - tables
              - timeline          - timeline       - insights
```

## Design Features

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Blue gradients for total budget
- **Success**: Green gradients for spent amount
- **Info**: Purple gradients for remaining budget
- **Dynamic**: Status-based colors for budget status

### Icons Used
- DollarSign - Main tab icon
- TrendingUp - Budget trends
- CheckCircle - Completed spending
- PieChart - Budget breakdown
- AlertCircle - Status warnings
- Users, Settings, FolderOpen, Zap, MoreVertical - Category icons

### Responsive Layout
- Cards: 4 columns on desktop, stacks on mobile
- Team grid: 3 columns on large screens, responsive stacking
- Tables: Horizontal scroll on small screens

## Data Calculations

### Mock Data Implementation
Currently uses calculated mock data based on:
- Spent amount Ã— category percentages for cost categories
- Random generation for task costs (will be replaced with real data)
- User-based calculations for team member costs
- Proportional distribution for monthly timeline

### Future Backend Integration Points
```typescript
// API endpoints to be implemented:
- GET /api/projects/:id/costs/categories
- GET /api/projects/:id/costs/tasks
- GET /api/projects/:id/costs/team
- GET /api/projects/:id/costs/timeline
```

## User Experience

### Interactive Elements
1. **View Switcher**: Toggle between 4 analysis views
2. **Time Range Selector**: Filter data by time period
3. **Export Button**: Download cost reports
4. **Hover States**: Enhanced visual feedback
5. **Tooltips**: Additional information on hover

### Visual Feedback
- Color-coded status indicators
- Progress bars with smooth animations
- Gradient backgrounds for emphasis
- Card shadows on hover
- Responsive transitions
