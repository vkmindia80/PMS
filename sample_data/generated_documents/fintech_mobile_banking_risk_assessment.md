# Risk Assessment: NextGen Mobile Banking Platform

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines a comprehensive risk assessment for the NextGen Mobile Banking Platform, a project aimed at delivering a state-of-the-art mobile banking experience leveraging AI, biometric security, and cross-platform integration. Given its critical priority within the financial technology domain, this project necessitates a robust risk management plan to ensure successful execution within a 12-month timeline, targeting increased user engagement and operational efficiency while maintaining stringent compliance and security standards.

## 2. RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

Our risk assessment methodology involves:
- Identifying potential project risks through stakeholder interviews and industry standards.
- Evaluating risks based on probability and impact scales.
- Prioritizing risks by severity to focus mitigation efforts.
- Developing mitigation strategies and contingency plans.
- Assigning risk ownership and establishing monitoring and review processes.

## 3. TECHNICAL RISKS

### 3.1 Integration Complexity with Legacy Systems
- **Probability**: High
- **Impact**: High
