- **Budget Limitations:** Operate within a $400K-700K budget.
- **Technology Access:** Address varying student access to technology.
- **Integration Needs:** Compatible with existing school information systems.

## 3. System Context and Scope

EduSmart caters to K-12 students, educators, administrators, and parents, providing tools for dynamic learning and efficient administration. It encompasses personalized AI tutoring, adaptive learning paths, a real-time analytics dashboard, virtual classroom experiences, and a content management system for educators.

## 4. Architectural Patterns

### Selected Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture:** Decouple functionalities for scalability and maintainability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use WebSocket for real-time collaboration.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Utilize Vue.js and Flask to separate concerns between data processing, user interface, and user requests.

## 5. System Architecture

The architecture is composed of multiple interconnected services deployed on Google Cloud Platform, ensuring scalability and resilience. Key layers include:

1. **Presentation Layer:** Built using Vue.js to ensure a responsive and interactive UI.
2. **Application Layer:** Developed with Flask, facilitating AI-driven adaptation through TensorFlow.
3. **Data Layer:** Utilizes MySQL for structured data and MongoDB for unstructured data storage, ensuring rapid retrieval and complex querying capabilities.

## 6. Component Architecture

- **AI Tutoring Module:** Implements adaptive learning algorithms, improving personalization.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time progress tracking, leveraging Flask and MongoDB for analytics.
- **Content Management:** Tools for educators to curate and manage learning materials.

## 7. Data Architecture

EduSmart employs a hybrid data model with:

- **Relational Databases (MySQL):** Store student records, academic progress, and administrative data.
- **NoSQL Databases (MongoDB):** To handle diverse content types and AI analysis outputs.

Data security is ensured by encryption protocols, in compliance with educational privacy regulations.

## 8. Security Architecture

Security is paramount, with a multi-layered approach including:

- **Data Encryption:** For data at rest and in transit.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Role-based access controls and OAuth 2.0 for secure identity management.
- **Regular Audits:** Continuous security audits to identify and rectify vulnerabilities.
